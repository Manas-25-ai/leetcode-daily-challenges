/**
 * Problem: Given an array of integers, find the total number of elements 
 *          that appear with the highest frequency.
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Use a HashMap to count the frequency of each number.
 * 2. Track the maximum frequency encountered during the count.
 * 3. Iterate through the frequency map and sum the frequencies of all numbers 
 *    that match the maximum frequency.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(n): We traverse the array once to count frequencies.
 * - O(k): We traverse the frequency map once to sum values (k = number of unique elements).
 * - Overall: O(n), since k â‰¤ n.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(k): Space used by the HashMap to store frequencies.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This solution is efficient for large arrays with repeated elements.
 * - It avoids sorting or nested loops, making it optimal for frequency analysis.
